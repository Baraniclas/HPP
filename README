# Intro
Malaria poses significant global health challenges, especially in regions with limited resources to combat
it. The transmission dynamics of malaria are complex, necessitating advanced computational models to
understand its spread, optimize resource allocation, and evaluate interventions. As scientific computing
has evolved, the combination of Monte Carlo (MC) methods with the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm
(SSA) has emerged as an effective and reliable tool in epidemiological research. MC methods involve
generating multiple samples from a probability distribution to approximate the behavior of complex
systems, providing insights into issues characterized by uncertainty and randomness, such as malaria
outbreaks. The SSA, a variant of the MC approach, is commonly used to model epidemic dynamics.
This algorithm simulates the progression of time in a stochastic system by tracking individual events
and their associated probabilities.

# Makefile
The makefile provides everything needed to create the executable, simply type "make", if the correct dependencies are not installed, see "Dependencies" below.
If you wish to remove the executable type "make clean".
If you wish to remove the output files generated by the program, run "make cleanall", WARNING!! This does remove all CSVs in the folder, so use carefully.

# Running the Code and input
to run the code simply type:
./MC N
"N" is the total amount of experiments which you want to be conducted.

# Output
The code generates a CSV file with all the output from the code.

# Limitations
N must be a positive integer.

# MC.h
A simple header file to keep the code files clean.
